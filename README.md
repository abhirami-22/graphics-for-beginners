## Basic computer graphics programs

* **q1.c**  
Program to draw 5 concentric circles in different colors. The centre coordinates and the initial radius is accepted from the user.

* **q2.c**  
Program to draw a filled sqaure. 

* **q3.c**   
Program to draw a star using two triangles in different colors. 

* **q4.c**   
Simple program to show a ball bouncing.

* **q5.c**   
Program to draw a line with slope < 1 using Bresenham’s line drawing algorithm. The end points of the line is accepted from the user. (the code also handles the case where the starting point is greater than the end point) 

* **q6.c**   
Program to draw a line with slope > 1 using Bresenham’s line drawing algorithm. The end points of the line is accepted from the user. (the code also handles the case where the starting point is greater than the end point) 

* **q7.c**  
Program to draw a circle using Midpoint circle algorithm. 

* **q8.c**   
Program to fill a square of using Boundary-fill algorithm 4-connected approach. 

* **q9.c**   
Program to fill a rectangle using Boundary-fill algorithm 8-connected approach. 

* **q10.c**   
Program to fill a square of multiple boundary colors using Flood-fill algorithm 4-connected approach. 

* **q11.c**   
Program to fill a rectangle already filled with a color with another color using Flood-fill algorithm 8-connected approach.
